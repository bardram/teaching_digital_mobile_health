# Introduction to Digital Health

Public repository for the DTU courses [22061 "Introduction to Digital Health"](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/22061) and [22060 "Mobile Health Technology"](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/22060). This repro contains misc. code and Flutter examples used in the courses.

* [FDC-LABS](/FDC-LABS/) - example of how to write the code from the FDC Book.
* [dart_examples](/dart.examples/) - a list of mic. Dart code examples used in class, including examples of how to use Lists, Maps, Futures, and Streams.
* [mvvm](/mvvm/) - a full Flutter example app designed according to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
* [mvvm_patterns](/mvvm_patterns/) - the same example app as [mvvm](/mvvm/) designed according to the MVVM architecture, but also including the use of software design patterns (Singleton, Facade, Observer, State).
* [mobile_sensing](/mobile_sensing/) - a Flutter app that illustrates how to collect data from onboard phone sensors by using different Flutter plugins. It collects data from the following sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, location (GPS), pedometer (step count), and ambient light.
* [wearable_streaming](/wearable_streaming/) - a set of 5 Flutter apps that illustrate how to implement **reactive** programming in Flutter and how to access and handle real **devices**. Shows how to integrate with the [Polar](https://www.polar.com/da) and [Movesense](https://www.movesense.com/) devices.
* [python_visualization](/python_visualization/) - a set of Jupyter Python notebooks showing how to plot heart rate (HR) and ECG data.
